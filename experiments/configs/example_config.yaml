# Example configuration file for running BNSL experiments.

# REQUIRED PARAMETERS

# Which algorithm to run. Must be one of:
#   - "silander_myllymaki"
#   - "partial_order_approach"
#   - "approximation_algorithm"
algorithm: approximation_algorithm

# Either specify a list of individual network files:
networks:
  - networks/mildew.bif

# or give a directory where you want to load all network files from:
# networks_dir: "networks/"

# Number of samples to generate 
sample_sizes: [1000, 5000, 10000, 100000]


# OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

# Used only by the approximation algorithm
# Each entry is a combination of (k, l)
k_l_grid:
  - {k: 4, l: 2}
  - {k: 6, l: 1}

# Used only by the partial order approach
# Each entry is a combination of (m, p)
m_p_grid:
  - {m: 4, p: 2}
  - {m: 5, p: 3}
